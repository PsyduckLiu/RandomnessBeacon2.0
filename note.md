## class groups (Cl) of imaginary quadratic orders

Cls are easy to generate. Their most interesting and useful property is that finding the group order is considered hard.

## Group Element Representation

Group Element can be represented as (a,b,c) or (a,b,Î”) triple (correspond to BinaryQF and ABDeltaTriple structures respectively).
